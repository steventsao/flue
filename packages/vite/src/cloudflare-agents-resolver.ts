/**
 * Resolution for the Cloudflare Agents SDK (`agents`), which the generated
 * Worker entry imports but the user's project does not have to declare:
 * `@flue/vite` ships it as its own dependency, so every project gets the SDK
 * minor Flue is tested against rather than whatever a scaffolded range would
 * resolve to on install day.
 *
 * A copy reachable from the project root always wins — a project that
 * declares its own `agents` dependency (to run a different SDK version) gets
 * it everywhere, and Vite's default pipeline resolves it with no help from
 * this plugin. Only when the root can't reach one (package managers with
 * strict, non-hoisted layouts) does the plugin resolve from `@flue/vite`'s
 * own install, re-entering Vite's resolver so the active environment's
 * conditions still pick the entry.
